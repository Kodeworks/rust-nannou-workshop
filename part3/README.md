# ðŸŒŠ Part 3: Perlin noise flow fields

This part is a gateway to the official examples in Nannou.
In the [Sources for inspiration and learning](/texts/sources_of_inspiration.md) document there are links to the three main for examples from the [Nannou repository](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou).

We will in this part look at one of the examples from [Generative Design](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou).
The example we will look at is [m_1_5_03](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/blob/master/generative_design/random_and_noise/m_1_5_03.rs).

ðŸ“Ž _The example already exists as a p5.js program [here](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_5_03) that you can test also. It can be nice to compare the JavaScript/p5.js to the Rust/Nannou implementation._

As with Part 2, this part will build the implementation in steps, but not in a very "exercisey" way.

We will work with the code in `part3/src/main.rs` and make our implementation there.
To run your code you can run this command in the terminal:

```
cargo run --bin part3
```

If you run the code now you will see a much simpler version, it is only on a black dot moving towards the right.

The suggestions for the exercises can be run with:
```
cargo run --bin part3a
```
Substituting the `a` with the letter of the exercise.

## ðŸŒŠ Exercise 3-A: A struct of its own implementation
Our starting point is a simpler program where we extend a line towards the right.

We are now using the `model` and `update` function to initialize and update our state.

ðŸ“œ Let's put the circle into a separate struct called `Agent`, so that we can keep the data and behaviour defined in a separate entity.
Give the `Agent` data members for `vector` and `position`, and implement a `display` and `update` function for it.

The calling code in our program's `update` function will look like this:
```rust
fn update(_app: &App, model: &mut Model, _update: Update) {
    model.agent.update();
}
```

and the calling code in the `view` function will look like this:
```rust 
fn view(app: &App, model: &Model, frame: Frame) {
    let draw = app.draw();

    draw.background().color(WHITE);

    model.agent.display(&draw);

    draw.to_frame(app, &frame).unwrap();
}
```

We now have two `structs`:
```rust
struct Model {
    agent: Agent,
}

struct Agent {
    vector: Vec2, //The movemement vector, i.e. how fast and in what direction we travel
    position: Vec2, // The current position
}
```
Initialized like this:

```rust
    let agent = Agent{
        vector: vec2(1.0, 0.0), //moving one pixel to the right per frame
        position: vec2(0.0, 0.0),
    };

    Model{
        agent
    }
```

</details>

Running `cargo run --bin part3a` shows us a moving circle again, now in its own struct!

## ðŸŒŠ Exercise 3-B: Initialize Agent with constructor function
Instead of initializing the struct directly we would like a separate function that does the work for us.

ðŸ“œ Implement a constructor for the `Agent` that initializes the position to a random position on the screen.

<details><summary> ðŸ™ˆ Constructing struct instances: </summary>

```rust
impl Agent{
    //A constructor function does not have the `self` argument, i.e. it is called
    // by `Agent::new` syntax.
    fn new(win_rect: Rect) -> Self {
        let position = vec2(
            random_range(win_rect.left(), win_rect.right()),
            random_range(win_rect.top(), win_rect.bottom()),
            );
        Self{
            vector: vec2(1.0, 0.0),
            position,
        }
    }

    //[...snip...]
}
```
And it is called like this:
```rust
    //Call the constructor with the window rect as argument
    let agent = Agent::new(app.window_rect());
```

Running `cargo run --bin part3b` shows us a moving circle again, now in its own struct!

## ðŸŒŠ Exercise 3-C: An army of `Agents`
If we want that cool particle agent army energy going, we have to create lots of them.
Now we will have to add one constructor call per agent we create.

ðŸ“œ Lets use a looping statement and create multiple agents and store them in a Vec.

<details><summary>ðŸ’¡ This time we will use an Iterator over a range, instead of a `for` loop:</summary>

```rust
    let items = (0..50)
        .map(|_| Widget::new()) 
        .collect();
```
This is a cleaner pattern than if we e.g. were to create a mutable variable and push to the items vector in a `for` loop.

</details>

<details><summary> ðŸ™ˆ Creating multiples using Iterators: </summary>

Out Model now uses a `Vec` with `Agent`s inside:
```rust
struct Model {
    agents: Vec<Agent>,
}
```

And we construct the agent army like this:
```rust
    let agent_count = 50;

    let agents = (0..agent_count)
        .map(|_| Agent::new(app.window_rect())) 
        .collect();
```

Drawing our agents is using an iterator:
```rust 
    model.agents.iter().for_each(|agent| {
        agent.display(&draw);
    });
```

Updating the agents also is done using an iterator over mutable references:
```rust 
fn update(_app: &App, model: &mut Model, _update: Update) {
    //We have to use a special iterator, iter_mut, because we mutating the data in each agent
    model.agents.iter_mut()
        .for_each(|agent| agent.update());
}
```

</details>

Running `cargo run --bin part3c` shows us an army of agents flying into the distant right, never to return.
