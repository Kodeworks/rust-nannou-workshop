Letting yourself be inspired by the work of those of come before you is a key ingredient for any experimentation, exploration, and innovation.
There is a lot of interesting work out there that you may want to have a look at, either it pertains to Rust programming, Nannou, or graphics programming in general.

This is a collection of links to examples and resources that you may find yourself wanting to take a look at at some point.


## Nannou
[Nannou](https://nannou.cc/) is a relatively young library, so it doesn't have the same amount of community-members as for instance Processing.
There are some nice examples in the Nannou repo that can get you quite far in knowing what is possible to do with the library.

### Official examples
In the [Nannou repo](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) there are three sections with examples that you may want to check out:
* [Basic examples](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/examples)
  * More technically oriented examples, showing the nuts and bolts at play.
  * Divided into thematic chapters
  * You can run an example with e.g. `cargo run --example draw`
* [Nature of Code examples](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/nature_of_code)
  * Many have probably heard of Daniel Shiffmans [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/). The examples is this directory are the same material ported to Rust.
  * You can run an example with e.g. `cargo run --example 4_03_particle_system_type`
* [Generative Design](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/generative_design)
  * Code from [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) ported to rust.
  * You can run an example with e.g. `cargo run --example m_1_5_02`
